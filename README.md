## Amazon Item Tracker
---
This python script uses Beautiful Soup and requests to scrape the amazon link chosen to track an item's price.  
The main code also uses the Twilio library to make access to the Twilio API easier, which will send a message 
to the desgnated phone number letting the user know what price the item is at.
